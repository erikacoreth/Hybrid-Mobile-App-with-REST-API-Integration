# 📱 Hybrid Mobile Maps & Weather App  
**React Native | Expo | Google Maps API | OpenWeather API**

This project is a cross-platform mobile application built using React Native with Expo that displays an interactive Google Map and retrieves real-time weather data for a selected location. The app integrates the Google Maps API for map rendering and the OpenWeather REST API to fetch and display live weather information.

This project represents the hybrid mobile implementation of a multi-platform system originally developed as a web app (Weeks 4–5) and a native iOS app (Week 6).

## 📈 Project Progression

- **Week 4:** Vanilla JavaScript Web App (Google Maps + OpenWeather)  
- **Week 5:** React Web App (Vite, Geolocation, CI/CD)  
- **Week 6:** Native iOS App (Swift & Google Maps SDK)  
- **Week 7:** Hybrid Mobile App (React Native & Expo – this project)  

This progression demonstrates the same system implemented across Web, Native Mobile, and Cross-Platform Mobile environments.
